# Finance Controle in Production

The Finance Control is a project of mine aimed to put in practice the knowledge adquired (and constantly updated)
of development.

Meanwhile there are two other repositories in this git hub account destined to the front-end and the back-end of the project, this one is destined to the files and configuration used to put the project under production. To do so, api's services run in Docker containers. It was also added a reverse proxy using Nginx.

In the future, the three repositories may be united in just one. Each repository was created at the pace that I 
started to study its respective subject (back-end, front-end and then production).
